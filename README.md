# Employee Attrition Analysis & Prediction

## 📋 Project Overview  
This project performs **HR Analytics to predict Employee Attrition** using machine learning.  
It helps businesses understand why employees leave and provides data-driven insights to reduce attrition.

---

## ✅ Objective  
- Analyze key factors contributing to employee attrition  
- Build a predictive model to forecast employee resignations  
- Visualize insights in an interactive Power BI dashboard  
- Explain model predictions using SHAP values

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used  
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, SHAP, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- Power BI  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Dataset: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset
